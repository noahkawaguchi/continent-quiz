# Continent Quiz

### ðŸ”— [Live link here](https://noahkawaguchi.github.io/continent-quiz/)

In this project, I use the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) for a simple quiz app that asks the user to choose the correct continent for random countries and regions. The project involves the following technologies and features:

- Building the project with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Testing the project with Jest and React Testing Library
- Allowing five "lives" (incorrect answers) before the quiz ends and saving high scores to local storage
